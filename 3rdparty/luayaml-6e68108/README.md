lua-yaml
========
Lua [YAML] serialization using [LibYAML].

Installation
------------

The following will build and install to the default location (`/usr/local`):

    make
    sudo make install

To change the installation prefix to `/usr` use:

    make
    sudo make install PREFIX=/usr

The Makefile also supports the [DESTDIR] convention, which packagers may
find useful for installing into a "buildroot".

[DESTDIR]: http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html

Usage
-----

The module defines the functions `dump`, `load`, and `configure` within the
global `yaml` table.

    require 'yaml'

    serialized = yaml.dump{1, 2, 3, 4}
    content = yaml.load(serialized)

Note that lua-yaml only supports YAML 1.1 (not 1.2). This is a limitation of
the underlying [LibYAML] library rather than lua-yaml itself.

Todo
----

* Make compatible with Lua 5.2
* Allow creating dump/load objects with internal configuration settings
* Better error checking when using LibYAML dump functions
